# Asynchronous Freeloader

## Multithreaded Asynchronous Image Downloader

### About
**Asynchronous Freeloader** is an asynchronous image downloader that utilizes Grand Central Dispatch and disk caching.

### Features:
- iOS 5+ Compatible
- ARC Compliant
- Image Scaling
- Disk Caching
- Support for placeholder/loading UIView object
- Multithreaded Image Downloading
- Automated Garbage Collections 

### Instructions:

#### Files
- Copy the 'Asynchronous Freeloader' folder into your Xcode project. The following files will be added:
	1. AsynchronousFreeloader.h
	1. AsynchronousFreeloader.m

#### Incorporating AsynchronousFreeloader to Existing Project
- Import **AsynchronousFreeloader.h** to your classes.
- Inspect **AsynchronousFreeloader.h** for heavily commented public methods.

#### Fetch Images
<pre>

+ (void)loadImageFromLink:(NSString *)link 
             forImageView:(UIImageView *)imageView 
      	  withPlaceholder:(UIImage *)placeholder
           andContentMode:(UIViewContentMode)contentMode;

</pre>
The parameters:

- ```link```: An NSString of the image's URL
- ```imageView```: The imageView in which to load the fetched image
- ```placeholder```: The image to display while fetching the image. A white UIActivityIndicatorView will be displayed on top of the image while loading. (if nil, only a large, white UIActivityIndicatorView is used)
- ```contentMode```: Allows you to set the scale/fill of the downloaded image (**added in v1.2.0**)


#### Caching
- NSUserDefaults are used to store an NSMutableDictionary.
- The NSMutableDictionary contains two objects:
	1. *pathsDictionary:* NSMutableDictionary of paths to images stored in a temporary folder on the disk. 
	1. *namesArray:* NSMutableArray of URLS to images, which are used as keys throughout the class. 
- Cache is emptied if number of entries exceeds a user-defined limit
	- This condition is defined by the *AsynchronousFreeloaderCacheSize* macro in **AsynchronousFreeloader.h**.
	- The default value is **100**.
- Failed Response
	- Place your error handling code in **failedResponseForImageView:** 
	- The method is empty by default.

###  Release Notes (v1.2.0):
-  Added support for user-preferred UIViewContentMode in image fetching method.
