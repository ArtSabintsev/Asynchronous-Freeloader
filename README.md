# Asynchronous Freeloader

## Multithreaded Asynchronous Image Downloader

### Important Note
I am no longer supporting this app as the disk-caching was added in iOS 5. Somehow it slipped under my radar, which is why I developed this library in the first place during the iOS5 era. 

More information about native disk caching can be found [on the following post over at Peter Steinberger's Blog](http://petersteinberger.com/blog/2012/nsurlcache-uses-a-disk-cache-as-of-ios5/).

The codebase will remain online and available for now. The old readme can be found in the **README_OLD.md** file.
